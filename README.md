## Project Description
In this project, you will think of a topic, find the data, complete an end-to-end analysis and present the data in multiple ways, all by yourself. First, choose a topic of interest to you and understand what research has already been done in that area. What are some interesting questions that remain? You will then find some data you think could help answer those questions and complete an analysis with relevant visualizations. Last, you will present your findings both in a presentation and a technical paper. 

<a name="project-goals"></a>

## Project Goals
* Research and analyse data on a topic of interest to you.
* Apply the programming and statistical techniques we have learned. 
* Create useful and easily-interpretable plots.
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately, and engagingly. 
* Learn to taylor the style of your communication to the audience.

## Requirements  
* You must plan your project. That is why creating a Kanban or Trello Board is mandatory. You have a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/YX8EsB2P/project-4-your-own-project).
* You **CANNNOT CODE** until you project is planned.
* Create a *.gitignore* file and include it in your repository.

## Deliverables
* A notebook with your analysis.
* Slides and a 3 minute presentation in the auditorium.
* Repository with your workflow + documentation + code. Even if you are working alone, you need to maintain good practices!
* A short technical paper including your motivation, methodology and results.

## Presentation  
Presentations for this project will be in the auditorium! Presentations will be **EXACTLY** 3 minutes long, with 2 additional minutes for questions. We will stop you!  
After the presentations, the audience will evaluate you by indicating how well they understood what you were trying to present and how you presented it. This information will help you in further presentations!

## Tips & Tricks
* Organize yourself (don't get lost!).
* Ask for help but also remember: Google is your friend!
* Start simple! 
* Learn about your subject and understand what research has been done already.
* You *can* use data from the projects your partners did in the last weeks. You can't use your own project.
* Before making a graph, think about what you want to represent.
